  ### Features Left to Implement

- Implement Gallery page.
- Implement hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- Implement different style for main slide when learning JavaScript.

## Testing

- The website was first tested using HTML W3C validator and CSS Jigsaw validator. For CSS no errors were found and for html main errors were found on contact us page as the social media links repeat twice so I had same ids twice.

- Testing the website for different screen sizes was the most difficult part. The main page was becoming distorted as the main slide was done by following a video, when reading and understanding each element on the css for the slide I noted that the position of the slide was absolute and had to find a different way to have the same effect for the slide so it wouldnt compromise the rest of the page when changing sizes.
- This website was also tested in chrome, microsoft edge, also different screen devices.
- Performance testing was done and the photos were downsized to improve performance.
- All links were tested: call, whatsapp message, social medias, form, and button links.
